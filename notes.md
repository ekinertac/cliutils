Great work! We've built a comprehensive CLI utility. Here are some valuable additions we could work on next:

## Potential Next Features:

### 1. **Validation/Check Commands**

```bash
util/commands/validate.py
```

- Validate JSON, YAML, TOML, XML, HTML, CSS syntax
- Validate email addresses
- Validate URLs
- Validate IP addresses
- Validate credit card numbers (Luhn algorithm)
- Validate file checksums

### 2. **Encoding/Decoding**

```bash
util/commands/encode.py
```

- URL encoding/decoding
- HTML entity encoding/decoding
- Unicode escape sequences
- Hex dump/undump

- Morse code

### 3. **Network Utilities**

```bash
util/commands/net.py
```

- IP address calculations (CIDR, subnets)
- DNS lookups
- Check if port is open
- Generate QR codes (for WiFi, URLs)
- Shorten URLs

### 4. **File Utilities**

```bash
util/commands/file.py
```

- Calculate file checksums (MD5, SHA256)
- Compare files
- Count lines of code
- Find duplicate files
- File type detection

### 5. **JSON/Data Utilities**

```bash
util/commands/json.py
```

- Pretty print JSON
- Query JSON with JSONPath
- Flatten/unflatten JSON
- Diff two JSON files
- Generate JSON schema

### 6. **Date/Time Utilities**

Expand the time converter with:

- Time zone conversions
- Date arithmetic (add/subtract days)
- Parse natural language dates
- Calculate duration between dates

### 7. **Packaging & Distribution**

- Publish to PyPI
- Add GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Create Docker image
- Add version checking

### 8. **Interactive Features**

- Interactive mode for complex operations
- REPL mode
- Fuzzy command search
- Command history

## My Recommendations:

**Quick Wins (Easy & Valuable):**

1. **Validation** - Very useful, easy to implement
2. **Encoding/Decoding** - Complements convert command
3. **File utilities** - Checksums are constantly needed

**High Value (More Complex):** 4. **JSON utilities** - JSONPath queries are super useful 5. **Network utilities** - IP/CIDR calculations help with DevOps

**Polish:** 6. **PyPI package** - Make it installable via `pip install cliutils` 7. **CI/CD** - Automated testing
